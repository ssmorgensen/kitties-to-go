      <h3>About Fred</h3>
        <p>Fred is a shelter cat turned celebrity now that he's part of the Kitties To Go! team. Some of his recent assignments include birthday parties, visiting sick kiddos
          in the hospital, and even a special appearance at a Super Bowl party.</p>
        <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter
          box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
        <p>When Fred isn't out on the town spreading his kitten love, you can find him hiding under his favorite blanket at the K2G! headquarters.</p>
